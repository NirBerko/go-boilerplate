## Project Structure

This starter kit divides the whole project into four main packages:

* `models`: contains the data structures used for communication between different layers.
* `services`: contains the main business logic of the application.
* `daos`: contains the DAO (Data Access Object) layer that interacts with persistent storage.
* `apis`: contains the API layer that wires up the HTTP routes with the corresponding service APIs.

[Dependency inversion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)
is followed to make these packages independent of each other and thus easier to test and maintain.

The rest of the packages in the kit are used globally:
 
* `app`: contains routing middlewares and application-level configurations
* `errors`: contains error representation and handling
* `util`: contains utility code
